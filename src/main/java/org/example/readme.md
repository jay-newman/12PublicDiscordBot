How to run the discord bot:

Go to https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/applications and create a new application. Then go to bot tab and click
add bot. Copy token and replace "add token here" with the token in file DiscordBot.java on line 12. DO NOT EXPOSE
YOUR TOKEN TO ANYBODY INCLUDING ON A PUBLIC GITHUB REPOSITORY!!! On the same website go to OAuth2 tab and click
URL generator sub tab. Decide what you want the bot to do. Beware if bot is given admin permissions. Take link
generated and paste in your own web browser then select what server you want to add the bot too. Add it to the server
and click continue. Authorize the bot. 

Run DiscordBot.java and your bot should have an activity of "playing Pokemon".
